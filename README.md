# 3D Platform for a Netflix campaing called "Estação N"

For this project conception, it was used REACT.js for the main page, AWS services for back-end and storage purpouses and Unity for the games and the 3D platform itself.

In the platform, a simple and easy-to-use code was done, and along with prefabs, the platform part was a relative fast proccess.

My participation on this project was:
- Front-end code and responsive layouts;
- The 3d platform creation (everything besides the art);
- The correct interaction between Web Front-end and Unity WebGL;
- Light adjustments and some polishments on main scene.
